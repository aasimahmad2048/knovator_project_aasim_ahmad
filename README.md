# Flutter Post Viewer App

This is a simple Flutter app that downloads posts from the internet and saves them on your phone. You can read the posts even when you're offline.

## Features

- **Get Posts Online**: Grabs a list of posts from the internet.
- **Save for Offline**: Saves all posts to your phone so you can see them anytime.
- **Track Read Posts**: When you read a post, it changes color so you know you've seen it.
- **See What's New**: If a post from the internet is different from the one you saved, an icon will show you it has been updated.
